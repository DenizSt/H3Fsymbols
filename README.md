# H3Fsymbols
These are the F-symbols for the H3 fusion category. There are two parameters in the solution which can both be either +1 or -1.

The solution has been obtained by solving the Pentagon equation with Mathematica and expoiting properties of trivalent categories.

The solutions is stored as a list of rules. The notation is as follows: F[a,b,c,d][e,f] corresponds to a matrix element of the matrix $$F_a^{bcd}$$.
